###  
BATcave houses my compilation of batch (`.bat`) files ranging from utility and productivity hacks to InfoSec and networking proof of concepts.

## ü§î What's a Batch File?
A file containing a set of DOS commands to be executed by the command line interpreter **CMD (Command Prompt)** in Windows and MS-DOS (legacy) operating systems.

Such a script can effectively automate manual tasks i.e. CLI commands in the operating system environment. File extension takes the form of `.bat` or `.cmd`.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What's Over Here?
 
- An attempt to lessen the daily frustrations of grumpy Windows users ~~(like me)~~ 
- Hacky workarounds to access apps via custom hotkeys or context menus    
- Some credential extractors off the network
- Network connectivity / performance monitoring scripts
- My solutions to the problems that I bumped into

## :briefcase: Pre-requisite

Windows provides DOS utilities out-of-the-box. A batch can be accessed through following means:

- **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)**
- **Double-click launch**
- **Powershell**
- **Git Bash** (weird but it works)
